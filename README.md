# Example Program 1: â€œCountdown

- Write a program that will ask a user for a number, then the program will output a countdown (in seconds) from that number to zero then ask again the user for new input.
> Hint: you can use the sleep function to halt the program for specified milliseconds.
- Must validate the input of the user.
- If the user inputs zero, the program should terminate.
