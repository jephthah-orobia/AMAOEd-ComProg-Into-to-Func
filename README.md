# Example 2: Inventory Management System

- Create a console app that displays the table:

    | ITEMS 		|  STOCK	|
    |------------------	|------------	|
    | Apples		|  10   	|
    | Bananas		|  20   	|
    | Oranges		|  15		|
    | Grapes		|  5		|
- Ask the user for string input (case sensitive and set a maximum number of characters), as to which item to create or update.
- Ask the user for INT input of how much there is on the inventory.
- if the item doesn’t exist on the table, create the item. If the item exist, update the entry for that item.
- Update the displayed table and continuously loop until user inputs “exit” for the item to terminate the program.
